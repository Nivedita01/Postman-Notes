# Analyzing API response

## Response formats

Postman offers 4 kinds of formats to look at the response returned.

1. Pretty - looks awesome, readable
2. Raw - Machine formatted
3. Preview - Similar to Raw, but legible
4. Visualize - Add-on visualizers are required to view data. More on this later.
